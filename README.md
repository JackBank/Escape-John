Escape John **READ ME**
===========

**NOTE** 
You will only get messages about updates nothing else! If you don't want to be kept updated anymore I will remove you from the tester list, since we don't want any spam! :)


**EARLY ACCESS TESTER** 
You are here probably because you are a tester. Feel free to download, play and review (constructive) the game and come with new ideas! (NOTE I am not an advanced developer)
This game is going to be available for early access testers when I got few levels, menus and some competitive enemies into the game so they can get a better experience in the game rather than get a stupid prototype.

**About this game** 
 The game is called Escape John, so the main character is called John, as you play the game there will be few stories which John will be telling about his escape events. You will be able to skip the stories BUT the stories may or may not be important for the level you are playing. Since he is telling the story I won't add a "Job brief" since it's about John.

**The game is inspired by the flash game series "Security"**

**Thanks a lot to..**
